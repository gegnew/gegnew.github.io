This is a blog, more or less. I want to keep track of the things I've been working on: Arch tweaks and edits, personal projects, thoughts about work and life. Maybe I'll even update it regularly.

This blog was built with Reverie,a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-powered theme which is simple and opinionated. It's actually a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) with some additional features and [personal touches](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/amitmerchant1990.github.io) which Amit Merchant modified to suit the needs of [his blog](https://www.amitmerchant.com).
